What is a network? A system of interconnected entities, such as computers, servers, routers, etc. that are linked together to share resources,
information, or services.

Physical

Physical Layer - Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices. (e.g. voltage level, cable specifications,
max transmission distances, physical connectors). 

Data Link Layer - Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer (e.g. PC -> switch, switch -> router, router -> router). Defines how data
is formatted for transmission over a physical medium. Detects and corrects Physical Layer error.

Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

Data 
Data | L4 Header    Segment
Data | L4 Header | L3 Header    Packet
L2 Trailer | Data | L4 Header | L3 Header | L2 Header   Frame


Ethernet Frame

Ethernet Header -> Preamble | Start Frame Delimiter | Destination | Source | Type
Packet
Ethernet Trailer -> Frame Check Sequence

Preamble: 
7 bytes long (56 bits) 
Alternating 1's and 0's
Allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks

Start Fram Delimiter (SFD):
1 byte long (8 bits)
10101011
Marks the end of the preamble, and the beginning of the rest of the frame.

Destination & Source:
Indicate the devices sending and receiving the fram
Consist of the destination and source 'MAC address'
MAC = Media Access Control
6 byte (48-bit) address of the physical device

Type / Length:
2 byte (16-bit) field
A value of 1500 or less in this field indicates the LENGTH of the encapsulated packet (in bytes)
A value of 1536 or greater in this field indicates the TYPE of the encapsulated packet, and the length is determined via other methods

Frame Check Sequence (FCS):
4 bytes (32 bits) in length
Detects corrupted data by running a 'CRC' algorithm over the received data
CRC = 'Cyclic Redundancy Check'

26 bytes in total (header + trailer)

MAC Address
6-byte physical address assigned to the device when it is made
A.K.A. 'Burned-In Address' (BIA)
Is globally unique
The first 3 bytes are the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), which is assigned to the company making the device
The last 3 bytes are unique to the device itself
Written as 12 hexadecimal characters

Dynamic MAC addresses are removed from the MAC address table after 5 minutes of inactivity. 

Preamble + SFD is usually not considered part of the Ethernet header

Minimum size for an Ethernet frame is 64 bytes. 
Minimum payload size is 46 bytes.
If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding bytes are added

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):
Used to desover the Layer 2 address (MAC address) of a known Layer 3 address
Consists of two messages: ARP Request & ARP Reply
ARP Request is broadcast = sent to all hosts on the network
ARP Reply is unicast = sent only to one host (the host that sent the request)

FFFF.FFFF.FFFF = broadcast MAC address

ping:
a network utility that is used to test reachability
measures round-trip time
uses two messages: ICMP Echo Request & ICMP Echo Reply
command: ping <ip-address>

show mac address-table
clear mac address-table dynamic address <mac-address>
clear mac address-table dynamic interface <interface-id>

Network Layer - Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (outside of the LAN)
Provides logical addresing (IP addresses)
Provides path selection between source and destination

IP addresses are 32 bits in length

IPv4 Address Classes
Class  First Octet  First octet numeric range

A      0xxxxxxx.x      0-127      /8
B      10xxxxxx.x      128-191    /16
C      110xxxxx.x      192-223    /24
D      1110xxxx.x      224-239   (multicast addresses)
E      1111xxxx.x      240-255   (reserved/experimental addresses)

Loopback Addresses
Address range 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
Used to test the 'network stack' on the local device

Host portion of the address is all 0's = Network Address
The network address CANNOT be assigned to a host

Host portion of the address is all 1's = Broadcast Address
The broadcast address CANNOT be assigned to a host

Max number of hosts = 2^(host bits) - 2

Cisco router interfaces are administratively down by default
Cisco switch interfaces ar eNOT administratively down by deafult

interface <interface> = enter interface configuration mode
ip address <ip address> <mask> = assign ip address and subnet mask
no shutdown = enable interface
show interfaces = displays information about interfaces

hostname <name> = configure's devices hostname
do show ip interface brief = view interfaces/ip addresses/status/protocol
